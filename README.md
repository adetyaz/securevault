# XRPL SecureVault

## Project Overview

**XRPL SecureVault** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) using Next.js. This platform combines decentralized identity (DID) management with multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets. It enhances security and provides users with robust tools to manage their identities and assets securely.

## Layman's Definition

XRPL SecureVault is a secure online platform built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) blockchain. It helps you manage your digital identity and control your online assets securely. With this tool, you can create a digital ID that only you control and set up wallets that require multiple approvals for transactions, making it extra safe from unauthorized access.

## Features

### 1. Decentralized Identity (DID) Management

- **DID Creation:** Users can create and manage their decentralized identities.
- **Verification:** Enable organizations to verify user identities.
- **Privacy Controls:** Users control what information is shared and with whom.
- **Integration:** Use XRPL for storing and managing DID-related data.

### 2. Multi-Signature Wallets

- **Multi-Sig Wallet Creation:** Users can create wallets that require multiple signatures for transactions.
- **Shared Accounts:** Enable shared control of funds (e.g., for organizations or families).
- **Security Features:** Enhanced security measures for asset protection.
- **Audit Trails:** Transparent transaction logs for auditing purposes.

### 3. Interoperability

- **DID and Multi-Sig Integration:** Link decentralized identities with multi-sig wallets for secure identity verification before transaction approval.
- **Seamless User Experience:** Unified interface for managing both identities and wallets.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Set Up XRPL and Development Environment

1. **Set Up XRPL Nodes:** Connect to XRPL Testnet or Devnet for development and testing.
2. **Install Necessary Libraries:** Use libraries like `xrpl.js` for interacting with the XRPL and `did-jwt` for DID management.

### Step 2: Develop Decentralized Identity (DID) Management

1. **DID Creation:** Implement functionality for users to create and manage their DIDs.
2. **DID Storage:** Store DIDs on the XRPL or use a decentralized storage solution.
3. **Verification Mechanism:** Develop a system for verifying DIDs by trusted entities.
4. **User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface for managing DIDs.

### Step 3: Implement Multi-Signature Wallets

1. **Multi-Sig Wallet Creation:** Enable users to create multi-sig wallets on the XRPL.
2. **Transaction Management:** Implement functionality for creating, signing, and submitting multi-sig transactions.
3. **Security Features:** Ensure robust security measures, such as requiring multiple approvals for sensitive transactions.
4. **User Interface:** Develop an intuitive interface for managing multi-sig wallets.

### Step 4: Integrate DID with Multi-Sig Wallets

1. **Link DIDs to Wallets:** Allow users to link their DIDs with multi-sig wallets for identity verification.
2. **Identity Verification:** Implement verification steps for approving multi-sig transactions based on DIDs.
3. **Unified Dashboard:** Provide a single dashboard for users to manage their identities and wallets seamlessly.

### Step 5: Testing and Deployment

1. **Comprehensive Testing:** Test the platform thoroughly on the XRPL Testnet or Devnet.
2. **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from beta users to improve the platform.
3. **Security Audit:** Conduct a security audit to ensure the platform is secure.
4. **Deployment:** Deploy the platform on the XRPL Mainnet.

## Next.js Specific Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Next.js Project

1. **Create a New Next.js Project:**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest xrpl-securevault
   cd xrpl-securevault
   ```
